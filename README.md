# Tokyo-Ramen-Takeichi-2024

## 1. Project Overview

Tokyo Ramen Takeichi is a renowned ramen chain that originated in Tokyo, Japan, and expanded its presence internationally. Known for its rich and flavorful broth, the chain has successfully established itself across several cities in the Netherlands and Germany.

As a part-time server at Tokyo Ramen Takeichi Amsterdam branch, I noticed that the restaurant has a large amount of data on sales and employee performance that remains largely untapped due to reliance on static spreadsheets.

Ramen Business is seasonal, peaking during the winter months and slowing down in summer. With growing competition, evidence-based marketing efforts and cost minimization are ccrucial to **enhancing business performance**. I initiated this project to promote **the transition from static spreadsheets to dynamic dashboards**, enabling managers to make strategic decisions in areas such as **seasonal promotions and staff scheduling**.

## 2. Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **Programming**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, re)
- **Data Modelling**
- **Data Visualization**
  
## 3. Data
- **Source**: The project was initiated by myself and is currently under consideration by the restaurant manager. I made use of employee and revenue data accessible at employee level
including daily schedules scraped from an external website and revenue data written in English by store staff.
- Data presented in accompanying dashboards are totally fabricated.

## 4. Results
- Dynamic reports on sales and employee performance.
